Instructions:

1. Main menu selection; Continue where you left off OR make a new "profile".
2. If you make a new profile, enter your goal for the study session (how many words to type) and the time you plan spending.
3. Start typing.
4. The more words you type, the more sounds you will get. If your typing is consistent, a meditative song will play to keep you focused.
5. Once your study session is ended or you reach your writing goal, a "celebration" window will show up to reward you.
