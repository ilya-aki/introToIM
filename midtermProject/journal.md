# Gamify your essay

On personal experience, I find it hard to enter a state of flow to write my essays. It is often an intimidating process that should not be left for the last minute. This is why I thought of gamification, a known technique that makes work more fun. Taking inspiration from pomodoro study techniques and smart fitness equipment UX (powered by sounds), I want to make a game that would reward the write on the go, as to build a habit to put down words fearlessly.


The game is conceptually simple. The user creates a profile to keep track of their progress. After establishing their goals for the work session, a progress bar will appear on top of a blank screen, where the user has space to write. It can be tempting to start writing "in your head"; first think through the ideas, and only then, type words. Yet this is a dangerous method as your mind can drift off to millions of new ideas that become number one distraction priorities. As to make the work more actionable, the game will produce sounds as the user types on their keyboard. These sounds will be subtle, and will build up into a meditative composition as the writer continues to type more and more. The stimulation to write is given only when the user starts an action, which is the key part in writing.
