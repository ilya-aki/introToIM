  # Loop Art
  There were quite a number of difficulties with setting up the variables, which I initially thought had to be defined inside the ````setup()```` function. Turns out, it needs to be mentioned before that.
The ````else```` function was not working in my ````while()```` loops. Through trial I found that it only works with ````for()```` loops. I also discovered (yet again) the importance of ordering code in Processing, as many times I have put the update statements after the loops executes (which in turn, didn't do anything). 
Overall, I think I never felt such a need to just draw on the screen, rather than setting up x and y coordinates for my shapes. It's a whole different way of thinking, and at this first, beginner phase, it takes time to translate visual ideas into a code/geometrical application.

Here is my final design;
