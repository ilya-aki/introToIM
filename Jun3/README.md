# Assignment 5

For this assignment, I wanted to focus on using transformations and classes above functionality or aesthetics.

My initial idea was to take the Bauhaus shapes (circle, square, triangle) and to make them interactive. When the user clicks one of the shapes, a number of smaller, similar shapes, appear on the screen, and fall down with gravity (as if bursting from the main shape). 
Using transformations went smoothly, and using push and pop helped in containing all the changes.

The main challenge came with setting up the classes. I have tried rewatching tutorials to understand what to use them for, and how to implement them. My first attempt was with the ellipses classes, and I wanted it to randomly generate small circles all around the screen when the mouse was clicked. I thought of using a while loop to limit the number of generated circles. My issue seems to be related to the way I call out the class, as when running the code, ```e.display()``` was marked as null. I do not know how to resolve this, as it seems to me that my setup is correct. 

This is an unfinished and barely functional code, but I hope to continue its development once I get to understand better how classes work.
