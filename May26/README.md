# Self portrait


I started this portrait by making a basic sketch to figure out the colors, as well as the placement each shape to create the landscape and the face.

Creating the background was mostly without difficulties. For the sun, I initially wanted to have rectangular rays of sunligh. That required using the rotate() function, however I quickly realized it was rotating the rectangle around the top left corner of the canvas (rather than around the top right corner where my sun is). I have tried using the transform() function to make the rectangle rotate around itself, but the positioning turned out much more complex and unsuitable for the available time.

Here's an example of what happened when using the rotate() function:

While the head and face were not challenging to create, the t-shirt required some calculations to ensure that both sleeves would look symmetrical. I superposed triangles and squares on each side to make this shape.

Here's the final result:
